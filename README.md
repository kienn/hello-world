Kien was raised in California, where everything is sugarcoated in sunshine and the colors pop like cartoons. He spent my youth building forts in burned-out cars, throwing rocks at the ocean, and traveling across the land, searching far and wide for the power that's inside.

Over the last eight years, Kien has created splendent stuff for agencies and independents and was recruited as the first design hire for two separate early-stage (pre-venture funding) startups. His work has been featured on Fast Company, LA Times, Gizmodo, and more.

Prior to working at tech startups, he discovered the joys of rearranging pixels in college, where he majored in graphic design.
